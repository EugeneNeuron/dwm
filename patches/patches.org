* Applied/tested
- [X] tag-indicator-big :: my tiny custom patch.
- [-] [[https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/attachdirection/][attachdirection]] :: Attachdirection is a merge of 1)attachabove, 2)attachaside, 3)attachbelow, 4)attachbottom and 5)attachtop
  - [ ] [[https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/attachasideandbelow/][attachasideandbelow]] :: Combination between attachaside and attachbelow. Clients will not be pushed down in the stack, only resized, and the master can't be pushed to the slave stack by spawning another client.
  - [X] :: attach-toggle :: my custom patch that let's you toggle between two favorite attach directions.
- [ ] [[https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/bottomstack/][bottomstack]] :: bstack and bstackhoriz are two stack layouts for dwm. Very good.
- [ ] [[https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/awesomebar/][awesomebar]] :: too big for now, but looks good.
- [ ] [[https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/canfocusrule/][canfocus]] :: remove the opportunity to focus certain windows. May be useful for tray applications. Looks nice but you've got a problem if you want to close this app (via MODKEY|Shift q) because you can't focus on that app. Or you can't move app up/down stack, or move it to a master screen. Can be improved.
- [ ] [[https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/activetagindicatorbar/][activetagindicatorbar]] :: looks bad for high fonts. Default size of tag indicator is a little bit small, so I applied tiny custom tag-indicator-big patch to make default rectangle tag indicator bigger.
- [ ] [[https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/bar_height/][bar height]] :: it was need for activetagindicatorbar, but now I don't need it anymore.
- [ ] [[https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/alttagsdecoration/][alttagsdecoration]] :: didn't find useful.
* TODO
- bartabgroups :: not going to use, just wanna try.
- [[https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/autostart/][autostart]] ::
- aspectresize ::
- [[https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/center/][center]] :: Add an iscentered rule to automatically center clients on the current monitor.
  Don't think that it's useful, but will give it a try.
- [[https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/alternativetags/][alternativetags]] :: Having icons as tags sure makes dwm look awesome, but having tags number simplifies tags related operations. This patch introduces alternative tags which can be switched on the fly for the sole purpose of providing visual aid.
* Not tested
- [[https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/actualfullscreen/][actualfullscreen]] :: Actually toggle fullscreen for a window, instead of toggling the status bar and the monocle layout.
- [[https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/alpha/][alpha]] :: Allow dwm to have translucent bars, while keeping all the text on it opaque, just like the alpha-patch for st.
- alwayscenter ::
- alwaysfullscreen ::
- autoresize :: don't see any demand for that.
- barpadding :: don't see any demand for that.
